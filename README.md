# FireCat

World's [second](https://github.com/IIIzP0III/zP--baa) tiniest plugin.

Does one thing and does it decently well:
Anyone who has Fire Resistance and also has this feature enabled will turn into a cat. :3

Requires Lib's Disguises to work, but it uses console commands so it'll work on the free version as well.

Usage: `/fc on` or `/fc off`

Permission node required: `firecat.allow`
