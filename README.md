# FireCat

World's [second](https://github.com/IIIzP0III/zP--baa) tiniest plugin.

Does one thing and does it decently well:
Certain potions will turn you into a mob.

- Anyone who has Fire Resistance with this enabled will turn into a kitty. :3
- Anyone who has Water Breathing with this enabled will turn into a foosh (salmon). üêü

Requires Lib's Disguises to work, but it uses console commands so it'll work on the
free version as well.

Usage: `/fc <cat|salmon> on` or `/fc <cat|salmon> off`

By default, the plugin does nothing. To enable it for everyone or allow people to
selectively enable it, you need to set the correct permission nodes:

- `firecat.<mob>.allow` (usage of the enable/disable command)
- `firecat.<mob>.default` (default enable the feature)
